Machine Learning - Project

Given two tasks (classification and regression), for each of them a comparison is made between different models in order to identify the differences between them and finally the best models are chosen based on their performance

Commands:
-In order to check out the Regression Task, run the "regression_ML-CUP" notebook 
-In order to check out the Classification Task, run the three notebooks (Monk1, Monk2, Monk3)
